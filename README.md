## Minesweeper AI Solver

An AI agent that automatically solves Minesweeper boards using logical inference
and probability-based reasoning.

### Overview
This project was originally developed as part of a AI course.
The implementation is my own and has been reorganized for portfolio purposes.

### Key Ideas
- Uses deterministic rules to identify guaranteed mines and safe cells
- Computes probabilities for uncertain cells
- Chooses the next move based on minimal risk

### Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Topics: AI reasoning, constraint satisfaction, probability heuristics
